# Backup & restore

Full-site backups: the PostgreSQL database, the media library, and a manifest
describing both, packed into one `.zip` archive that can be downloaded, stored
off-site, and restored.

Admin screen: **Admin → System → Backup & restore** (`/admin/settings/backups`).

---

## What a backup contains

A backup archive is a plain `.zip` with a fixed layout:

```
backup/manifest.json           metadata: version, app version, counts, checksums
backup/database/database.dump  pg_dump custom-format archive (binary, compressed)
backup/media/…                 every file in the media library, at its storage path
```

`backup/manifest.json` records the archive's own format version, the application
version, what the archive includes, and the SHA-256 of the database dump. It
**never** contains credentials, connection strings, API keys, or environment
variables — this is verified by a test.

Three types:

| Type       | Database | Media | Use it for                                |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `FULL`     | ✅        | ✅     | The real backup. Take this before upgrades. |
| `DATABASE` | ✅        | ❌     | Quick, small, frequent.                    |
| `MEDIA`    | ❌        | ✅     | After a large upload batch.                |

---

## Requirements

- **`pg_dump` and `pg_restore`**, matching the PostgreSQL server's major
  version. The production image installs `postgresql16-client`. Without them
  the admin screen shows a red banner and only `MEDIA` backups can run.
- **A persistent volume** at `BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH` when using local storage. A
  container filesystem is discarded on every deploy; a backup written to one
  disappears with it.

## Environment variables

| Variable                       | Default        | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `BACKUP_STORAGE_DRIVER`        | `local`        | `local` or `s3`.                               |
| `BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH`            | `/app/backups` | Must be a mounted volume in production.        |
| `BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT`           | —              | R2: `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `BACKUP_S3_REGION`             | `auto`         |                                                |
| `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`             | —              | Use a **private** bucket.                      |
| `BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`      | —              |                                                |
| `BACKUP_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  | —              |                                                |
| `BACKUP_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`   | `true`         | Required by MinIO and most R2 setups.          |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAILY`       | `7`            | Fallback when no schedule row exists.          |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_WEEKLY`      | `4`            |                                                |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_MONTHLY`     | `3`            |                                                |
| `BACKUP_MAX_IMPORT_MB`         | `2048`         | Upload limit for imported archives.            |
| `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`        | —              | Reserved; see *Encryption* below.              |
| `CRON_SECRET`                  | —              | Enables the scheduled-backup endpoint.         |

The backup bucket must be **separate from the media bucket**. Media is public;
a backup archive contains the entire database and must never be reachable by
URL.

---

## Storage

**Local** — archives are written under `BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH`, streamed to a
`.part` file and renamed on success so a killed process never leaves a
truncated archive that looks complete. Downloads are streamed through an
authenticated route; there is no public path to the directory.

**S3 / R2** — archives are uploaded with multipart upload, so a 5 GB archive
never has to fit in memory. Downloads redirect to a signed URL valid for ten
minutes, which keeps the bucket private.

---

## Scheduling

The application does not run its own scheduler — a Next.js container may be
replaced or scaled at any moment, and an in-process timer would either miss
runs or duplicate them. Instead, an external scheduler calls:

```
POST /api/internal/cron/backup
Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET
```

The endpoint is cheap and idempotent: it checks whether the configured schedule
is actually due, runs a backup only if it is, applies retention, and recomputes
the next run. Calling it every 15 minutes is fine and is the recommended
cadence — it means a missed window is picked up quickly.

When `CRON_SECRET` is unset or shorter than 16 characters the endpoint is
**disabled** (503), not open.

### Coolify

1. **Persistent volume** — Application → *Storages* → *Add*:
   - Name: `backups`
   - Destination path: `/app/backups`
   (Keep the media volume at `/data/uploads` as well — see
   [MEDIA-STORAGE.md](MEDIA-STORAGE.md). A backup covers the database and the
   media library, and a restore needs both.)

2. **Environment variables** — Application → *Environment Variables*: add the
   `BACKUP_*` values above plus `CRON_SECRET`. Generate the secret with
   `openssl rand -hex 32`. Coolify marks values as build- or runtime-scoped;
   these are runtime only.

3. **Scheduled task** — Application → *Scheduled Tasks* → *Add*:
   - Name: `backup-tick`
   - Frequency: `*/15 * * * *`
   - Command:
     ```sh
     curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
       http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/internal/cron/backup
     ```
   The task runs inside the container, so `CRON_SECRET` is already in the
   environment and the request never leaves the host.

4. Set the schedule itself (time, frequency, retention) in
   **Admin → System → Backup & restore**, not in the cron expression. The
   cron only asks "is anything due?".

### Any other host

A system crontab, a GitHub Actions schedule, or an uptime pinger works equally
well — anything that can send an authenticated `POST` on a timer. Do not expose
`CRON_SECRET` to a browser.

---

## Retention

Retention keeps a number of backups per tier rather than deleting after N days,
so the answer to "how far back can I go?" is always a count and pruning can
never empty the shelf:

- the newest `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAILY` backups,
- one per week for `BACKUP_RETENTION_WEEKLY` weeks,
- one per month for `BACKUP_RETENTION_MONTHLY` months.

**Never pruned:** manual backups, imported archives, and pre-restore safety
backups. Retention runs only after a scheduled backup has succeeded, so a
failed run cannot delete the last good archive.

---

## Restoring

Restore is deliberately hard to trigger by accident. It needs the
`backup.restore` permission (super-admin only by default) and the word
`RESTORE` typed into the confirmation dialog.

The sequence:

1. **A safety backup of the current site is taken first.** This is the rollback
   point and is never deleted automatically — including when the restore fails.
2. The archive is downloaded from storage and its SHA-256 checksum verified
   against the value recorded when it was created. A mismatch aborts before
   anything is written.
3. The manifest is read; an archive from another application, or in a format
   this build does not support, is refused.
4. **Maintenance mode is turned on**, so visitors see a holding page instead of
   a half-restored site. Signed-in staff are exempt.
5. The database is restored with
   `pg_restore --clean --if-exists --single-transaction --exit-on-error`, so a
   failure rolls the whole thing back rather than leaving a partial schema.
6. Media files are extracted, each path validated against traversal before it
   is written.
7. **Maintenance mode is turned off** — in a `finally` block, so a crash cannot
   leave the site dark.

Maintenance mode can also be toggled on its own from
**Admin → Settings → Website settings**. Turning it on calls
`revalidatePath('/', 'layout')`, which is what makes prerendered blog and
product pages re-render and pick the flag up — a statically cached page would
otherwise keep serving until its own revalidation window elapsed.

Because a database restore replaces the `Backup` table itself, the backup
inventory is snapshotted before the restore and merged back afterwards.
Otherwise the safety backup — the only way back — would vanish along with
everything else.

Only one backup or restore runs at a time, enforced by a lock row guarded by a
transaction-scoped advisory lock. The claim carries a six-hour expiry so a
killed container cannot wedge the system permanently.

---

## Importing an archive

**Admin → System → Backup & restore → Import archive** accepts a `.zip`
produced by this system. It is validated (zip structure, manifest present,
manifest version supported, dump present when claimed), checksummed, and stored
as a `COMPLETED` backup with origin `IMPORTED`.

Importing never restores. Restoring is a second, explicit step.

---

## Permissions

| Permission        | Default holders           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `backup.view`     | Admin, super-admin        |
| `backup.create`   | Admin, super-admin        |
| `backup.download` | Admin, super-admin        |
| `backup.settings` | Admin, super-admin        |
| `backup.restore`  | **Super-admin only**      |
| `backup.delete`   | **Super-admin only**      |

Restore replaces the entire database and delete destroys a rollback point, so
neither is granted to ordinary admins by default. Both can be assigned per role
in **Admin → Administration → Roles & Permissions**.

On an **existing deployment** the six `backup.*` permissions are new, so no
role holds them until they are assigned. A super-admin always has access —
`userCan` grants that role everything without consulting the list — so nobody
is locked out. To give the seeded Admin role its defaults, either tick the
permissions in Roles & Permissions or re-run the seed with `RUN_SEED=true`.
Note that the seed rewrites every system role's permissions from the code, so
it also discards custom grants made to those roles.

## Security

- Secrets are never written to a manifest, an archive, an audit row, a log
  line, or an API response. Every error leaving the subsystem passes through a
  redactor that strips `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`, SMTP
  passwords and any `postgres://user:pass@host` form — `pg_dump` and
  `pg_restore` echo the connection string in several of their error messages.
- `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` are invoked with `spawn()` and an argument array.
  No string is ever concatenated into a shell command.
- Every archive entry path is validated before extraction: `../`, absolute
  paths, Windows drive letters, UNC paths and null bytes are rejected (Zip
  Slip).
- Storage keys are generated by the application and validated against an
  allowlist pattern before reaching the filesystem.
- Backup archives are never served from a public path. Local storage streams
  through an authenticated route; S3 storage issues a ten-minute signed URL.
- The cron endpoint compares its bearer token with `timingSafeEqual`.
- Downloads, restores, deletions and settings changes are all written to the
  audit log.

## Encryption

`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is reserved and **not yet applied to archives** — the
storage interface is in place, but archives are currently written unencrypted.
Until it lands, protect archives with storage-level controls: a private bucket
with server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS), or an encrypted volume.

Anyone adding it should note the trade-off that has kept it out: an encryption
key that is lost makes every archive encrypted with it unreadable, which
converts a backup system into a way to lose data. It needs key rotation and a
documented escrow procedure, not just a cipher.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Database backups are unavailable"** — `pg_dump` is missing from the
container. Confirm the image installs `postgresql16-client` and redeploy.

**`pg_dump: server version mismatch`** — the client is older than the server.
Bump the `postgresql<N>-client` package in the `Dockerfile` to the server's
major version.

**"Another backup or restore is running"** — expected while one is in flight.
If nothing is actually running, the claim lapses after six hours; the
`clearStaleLock()` helper releases it sooner.

**Scheduled backups never run** — the cron endpoint is not being called. Check
that `CRON_SECRET` is set (≥16 characters) and that the scheduled task exists.
Call it manually with `?force=1` to test:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  'http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/internal/cron/backup?force=1'
```

**Backups vanish after a deploy** — `BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH` is not on a persistent
volume. Add the volume, and use S3/R2 for anything you cannot afford to lose.
