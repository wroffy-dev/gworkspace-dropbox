# Changelog

All notable changes to this application. The version here is the **application
version** — see [VERSION_README.md](./VERSION_README.md) for what that is, how
to move it, and why it is not the same thing as a consent notice version.

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Admin dark mode** — a Light / Dark / System theme toggle in the admin
  topbar (in the account menu on phones). The choice is remembered in this
  browser, System follows the operating system live, and an inline script
  applies it before the first paint so a reload never flashes light. Admin
  only: everything is scoped to `.admin-ui`, so the public site is unchanged.
  Glass surfaces, tinted status chips, the switch knob, preview frames and the
  dark logo (when one is set in Settings) are all handled.
- **Admin design system, phase 2** — module screens (admin only):
  - **Products**: Total, Published, Draft and Removed for the market being
    worked in; Removed counts exactly what Removed Products lists (one shared
    rule).
  - **Cities**: Total, Active and Published cities and City pages, in the same
    market scope as the list.
  - **SEO Intelligence**: score cards on glass; the audit table stays solid.
  - **Slug & URL Manager**: the tab bar stays under the topbar while a long URL
    list scrolls (desktop).
  - **Media**: "4 files · 1.9 KB stored" instead of "4 file(s) · 0.0 MB".
  - The strip around the floating topbar fades into the workspace, so content
    no longer shows through above it.
- **Admin design system, phase 1** (`docs/ADMIN-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`): clean SaaS
  with controlled Liquid Glass, scoped to the admin by an `.admin-ui` class
  so the public site's colours, fonts, radii and buttons are untouched.
  - Shell: a floating light-glass sidebar (256px, 76px collapsed) grouped
    under WEBSITE, CUSTOMERS, GROWTH, LOCATIONS and ADMIN — Countries, Cities
    and the City Page Generator as direct links — and a floating glass topbar
    with a View website action.
  - Tokens for the palette, radii (cards 18px, controls 12px, menus 14px),
    depth and a system sans-serif; near-black primary buttons with the brand
    colour kept for accents, active states and focus rings.
  - Glass KPI cards with a trend and a sparkline (the dashboard's Total leads
    compares the last 15 days with the 15 before), glass dropdown menus,
    filter toolbars and drawer shells; tables, forms and editors stay solid.
  - Page headers wrap their actions under the title rather than squeezing
    it; the list search keeps a usable width; Quick actions no longer cut
    their labels short.
- **Image section editor with live preview** (Pages → a page → an Image
  section). The Content tab shows the image beside its controls — side by side
  when the editor is wide, stacked on tablets and phones — and redraws as you
  edit, for Desktop, Tablet or Mobile. Controls are grouped (Image, SEO &
  Accessibility, Layout, Responsive, Link, Appearance) into sections that open
  and close. The preview draws with the same component as the published page.
  - Alignment can now differ per screen size, like width already could.
  - Corner radii come from the site's layout tokens; new sections start at
    Medium. Shadows are softer and layered.
  - The alt text field is stored as `imageAlt`, like every other block's;
    sections saved with the old `altText` are still read.
- **Liquid Glass styles**: `.liquid-glass`, `.liquid-glass-soft`,
  `.liquid-glass-panel` and `.liquid-tab-active`, built on two tokens so a
  dark theme can retune them. Used only on the section editor's tabs, the image
  preview panel and the media picker, with a solid fallback where the browser
  cannot blur and for reduced transparency.
- **Image section** (Page Builder → Add section → Cards & media → Image): one
  image from the Media Library with its own alt text (blank uses the library's),
  a decorative switch, optional title and caption (`<figure>`/`<figcaption>`).
  - **Layout**: left, centre, right or full-width alignment; width presets
    (auto, 25–100%) or a custom length per desktop, tablet and mobile (mobile
    defaults to 100%); optional maximum width; aspect ratio, fit and focal
    point. The Design panel's responsive Image width overrides the widths.
  - **Link**: the whole image can link anywhere, optionally in a new tab
    (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`), through the same safe-URL check as buttons.
  - **Appearance**: corner radius presets or a custom radius, optional border
    (width, colour) and shadow. Every length and colour is validated; nothing
    reaches the page as raw CSS.
  - A missing or deleted image shows an empty slot in the admin preview and
    nothing to visitors. Stored in `PageSection.content`; no migration.
  - Block editor fields may now carry a `group`, shown as a subheading.

- **Cities** (Admin → Locations → Cities, `/admin/cities`): local address
  spaces inside a market — `/delhi` in the root market, `/ae/dubai` in the UAE.
  Country stays the market; a city holds a slug, an optional region, contact
  details and search defaults; its landing page and every other page in it
  are ordinary pages built in the Page Builder.
  - **One owner per address, still.** The URL registry files a page under a
    city from its address and refuses anything else in a city's space; a
    city's slug is refused while anything else holds its address or content
    beneath it, with the address and its owner named. No per-city routes.
  - **Status**: an inactive city's pages answer 404 until it is switched back
    on, and nothing is deleted; an unpublished, noindexed or excluded city's
    pages leave the sitemap.
  - **Search and contact details** fall back Page → City → Country → Global,
    for the public page and SEO Intelligence alike, which gains a City filter.
  - **Deleting** is refused while a city has pages, with the count and an
    offer to deactivate instead.
- **City Page Generator** (Admin → Locations → City Page Generator): copies a
  page into many cities — `dropbox-plus` becomes `/delhi/dropbox-plus` — with
  a preview of every address and what already holds it, placeholders such as
  `{{city.name}}` filled once, one transaction per city, and a summary of
  created, skipped and failed pages. Existing pages are never overwritten, and
  generated pages are independent: nothing syncs them with their source.
- Migration `20260930120000_cities`: additive only. Existing pages get
  `cityId = NULL` and behave exactly as before.

### Changed

- Syncing or cloning a market leaves city pages out, since a city belongs to
  one market. Deleting a market also deletes its cities, and says so.
- The Pages list has a City filter and a city badge, and the page editor says
  which city a page belongs to and where it was generated from.
- **Admin navigation reorganised** into Dashboard, Website, Products, Content,
  Leads & CRM, Marketing, SEO, Reports, Locations, Administration, System and
  Settings. Only where things are listed changed: every URL, permission and
  screen is the same.
  - Popups → Marketing; Countries → Locations; Staff, Roles & Permissions and
    the Audit Log → Administration; Recycle Bin, Backup & Restore and Seed
    Files → System; Consent Notice sits with Forms; SEO is its own module.
  - Breadcrumbs follow the new tree, add a middle step for nested screens
    (Content › Blog › Categories), link a detail screen back to its list, and
    only link to screens the signed-in user may open.

### Fixed

- **One sidebar item lights up per screen.** Roles & Permissions also lit up
  Staff, UTM Campaigns lit up Tracking & Pixels, and Backup & Restore lit up
  Website Settings; a filtered Reports list (`?from=`) or tag search (`?q=`)
  lit up nothing and lost its breadcrumb.
- **Icon cards and Icon box: an uploaded image now sticks.** Choosing a
  Media Library image (PNG, SVG or any other) for a card that already had an
  icon wrote the image and then cleared the icon from the same stale values,
  so the image was dropped. The artwork picker now writes both in one change.
- **SVG uploads from design tools are accepted.** The upload check read any
  attribute with "on" inside its name as an event handler, so every Inkscape
  file (`standalone="no"`) and attributes like `exponent` were refused. It now
  matches only attribute names that begin with "on"; scripts, event handlers,
  embedded HTML and remote references are still rejected.
- SVGs show whole in the media picker instead of being cropped.
- **A deleted brand or product category still showed on product pages**, in
  the product's structured data and in its SEO score. Deleting one puts it in
  the recycle bin with its products still pointing at it, so restoring it
  reconnects them; while it is deleted it is no longer shown, linked or
  described anywhere public.
- **Two test suites had stopped running in CI**, which kept every deployment
  at its quality gates. The settings and menu Server Actions imported the
  icon components just to read the list of icon names; the list now lives in
  a module of its own. The brand-deletion test checks the recycle-bin
  behaviour rather than the hard delete it predates.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Slug & URL Manager** (Admin → SEO → Slug & URL Manager, `/admin/slug-manager`)
  and the **URL registry** behind it. Every public address now belongs to
  exactly one thing — a page, a product in one market, an article, a blog
  category or tag, the blog archive, or a redirect — enforced by a unique
  database key on the normalised address and one registry lock for writers.
  Content is identified by id and market; its URL is an attribute that can
  change without breaking a link.
  - **Addresses are decided** by a custom address, then the market's pattern,
    then the global pattern, then the built-in default (which is exactly what
    the site used before, so nothing moves on upgrade). Prefixes can be
    removed (`/products/dropbox` → `/dropbox`), replaced
    (`/software/{slug}`), nested, or set per market
    (`/ae/products/dropbox` → `/ae/dropbox`), and the blog can move
    (`/blog/article` → `/insights/article`). A custom address is kept through
    every pattern change; a title edit never changes a published address.
  - **All URLs**: search, market, type, status and mode filters, pagination,
    multi-select, an edit drawer with live availability, the final URL on the
    site's domain, the inherited pattern, redirect details and *Reset to the
    inherited pattern* with a preview. **URL Patterns**, **Redirects**,
    **Conflicts** (who owns a taken address, and free alternatives),
    **History** (with a validated restore) and **URL Health** (recorded 404s,
    redirect problems, broken internal links — from real data, without
    fetching anything).
  - **Automatic permanent redirects** whenever an address that has been public
    changes. Redirects point at content by id, so they never chain, and every
    earlier address goes straight to the current one. Loops and collisions are
    refused; query strings, UTMs included, are carried over.
  - **Bulk changes** — selected rows, prefix replacement, pattern changes and
    CSV import/export keyed by id, market and target path — are previewed row
    by row (change, unchanged, conflict, invalid, excluded, duplicate) and
    applied only if the preview is still current. Large ones run in batches
    with progress and can be resumed.
  - **Permissions**: `seo.manage` to open it, plus permission to edit the kind
    of content and access to its market for every change, checked row by row
    on the server.
  - Content forms, duplication, restore from trash, market copies and market
    prefix changes go through the same validation.
  - Every link — cards, menus, CTAs, breadcrumbs, the market switcher,
    canonical and Open Graph URLs, JSON-LD, sitemaps, hreflang and SEO
    Intelligence — is built from the registry, and another market's version of
    a page or product is found by identity rather than by slug. Explicit
    canonical URLs are listed for review, never replaced; stored links that
    exactly match a moved address can be rewritten on request.
  - Ships **switched off**. Adopt it with a scan
    (`npm run urls:backfill`, `-- --dry-run` to rehearse), a review of
    Conflicts, and *Switch on*. Switching off is the rollback: the previous
    router takes over at once, and addresses the registry gave out redirect
    temporarily to where that router serves the content. See
    [docs/URL-REGISTRY.md](./docs/URL-REGISTRY.md).
- **The bare domain redirects to the site address.** A request on the `www` or
  bare twin of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is sent to it with a 308, keeping path and
  query. `CANONICAL_HOST_REDIRECT=false` switches it off where a proxy already
  does it.

### Changed

- **Admin → SEO → Redirects** now lives in the Slug & URL Manager's Redirects
  tab; the old address forwards there. Redirects can target content by id, be
  enabled or disabled, carry a note, and show hits and when they last fired.
- `Redirect.source` is no longer unique on its own: one owner per address is
  now enforced by the registry, per market. The migration
  (`20260929120000_url_registry`) is additive otherwise — no data is rewritten
  and no public address changes.
- The address hints in the product, article, category and tag forms follow the
  URL patterns the site serves.
- `npm run market:clone` ends with a reminder to run a URL scan, because content
  it writes straight to the database is not registered until then.

### Fixed

- **A market's "Ask search engines not to index this market" switch sprang
  back on, and every page of the market sent noindex.** Two causes, both in
  saving the market's settings:
  - the form sends every value as text, and `z.coerce.boolean()` read
    `"false"` as true, so every save switched the market to noindex and out
    of the sitemaps (fixed in the entry below; now covered by tests);
  - the form refused values the application itself had stored: the
    multi-country migration copies the site's default title (up to 240
    characters) and email (up to 200) into the root market, where the form
    allowed only 200 and 160. The whole save was rejected with "Please correct
    the highlighted fields" and nothing highlighted, so the switches stayed on.
    The limits now match the global settings, and a refused save names the
    field, shows the message beside it and moves to it.
- **A market asked not to be indexed was still listed in the sitemaps**, and
  the blog — served from the root market — stayed listed when the root market
  was excluded or noindexed. Sitemaps now list only markets that are neither,
  hreflang alternates skip them too, and the site-wide noindex switch withholds
  every market.
- **The settings screen said the market noindex is also sent as an
  `X-Robots-Tag` header.** It never was: public pages carry it as a robots meta
  tag, and only `/admin` and the sign-in screen send the header. The text now
  says what happens. `npm run check:indexing -- https://your-domain / /ae`
  reports both, plus robots.txt and the sitemaps, for any deployed site.

- **"Off" switches in country settings and country pricing saved as "on".**
  `z.coerce.boolean()` reads any non-empty string as true, so a form posting
  `"false"` for *Hide this country from search engines*, *Leave this country
  out of the sitemap*, a market's noindex or its Featured flag stored `true`.
  Those four fields now read `"true"`, `"on"` and `"1"` as on and anything else
  as off. Worth checking those settings on each market once this is deployed.

- **A product's structured data named the website as its brand.** The Product
  JSON-LD now uses the product's own brand, falling back to the site name only
  when it has none, and a product page with visible FAQ sections now describes
  them as `FAQPage`, as CMS pages already did.

- **Deleting a product from one market deleted it from every market.** The
  product screen is country-scoped, but delete set the global `Product.deletedAt`
  — so removing a plan from the UAE catalogue removed it from India and Qatar
  too, without anyone there being asked. Deletion is now a withdrawal from one
  market: `ProductCountry.deletedAt` archives that market's configuration, and
  the shared product row is only retired once no market offers it. Bulk delete
  was the same bug at twenty times the scale and is fixed the same way.

- **Deleting a category or brand from one market deleted it everywhere.** The
  taxonomies are shared rows, so a country screen's delete removed the row
  everybody used. Three new availability tables — `ProductCategoryCountry`,
  `PageCategoryCountry`, `BrandCountry` — record which markets offer what, and a
  country-scoped removal now deletes one availability row. The shared row is
  removed only when no market offers it at all.

- **`/admin/products` listed the global catalogue**, so a UAE administrator saw
  and could delete India's products. It now lists the market being worked in,
  and the Status, Featured, price and currency columns read that market's own
  configuration rather than the global product's.

### Changed

- **The country sync is add-only.** `UPDATE_EXISTING` is gone from the interface
  and from the engine. Content a market already has is skipped however much it
  has been edited; content a market imported and then deleted stays deleted;
  content only that market has is untouched; and deleting something in India
  never touches a copy already synced elsewhere.

- **Manually deleted content is no longer resurrected.** `CountrySyncMapping`
  gains `deletedInTargetAt`. When a run finds a previously imported copy gone it
  records a tombstone and reports *"Previously imported but manually removed from
  this country"*; every later run reaches the same conclusion. The mapping has no
  foreign key to the row it points at, which is what lets the tombstone outlive
  the deletion.

- **The sync allowlist covers the rest of a market's website**: page categories,
  product categories, brands, forms, products, pages, page sections, menus and
  popups, in dependency order. Menu links are remapped to the target market's own
  pages, and a link whose page was not imported is dropped rather than left
  pointing at India.

- **Canonical URLs are no longer carried across.** A copied `canonicalUrl` named a
  URL on India's site, which tells search engines the target market's page is a
  duplicate that need not be shown. The field is left empty so each market's own
  canonical generator answers for it.

- **Every non-default market gets a "Sync from India" button** on Settings →
  Countries; the default market never does. The source is resolved server-side
  from the default-country configuration and is never taken from the browser, so
  no request can ask for UAE → Qatar.

- Preview and result both break down by content type, name what was left removed,
  and show failures rather than swallowing them. Delete confirmations name the
  market: *"Remove this product from UAE?"*, with a line saying other markets are
  unaffected.

- Mapping and target lookups are batched per entity kind rather than issued per
  item, so a market with hundreds of imported records costs one query instead of
  hundreds.

- **A product page's features section has one heading, "Top benefits of" the
  product,** over both of its lists. `{product}` in the heading is the
  product's name. The old built-in sub-headings, "What is included" and "Why
  teams choose it", are gone; a sub-heading somebody wrote is kept.

### Added

- **Domain and redirect checks.** `npm run check:domain -- https://www.your-domain`
  follows the bare and www addresses over http and https, hop by hop, and
  fails on a temporary (302/307) redirect, a chain, a loop or a lost path or
  query; then it checks the canonical tags, og:url, hreflang, robots.txt and
  the sitemaps all use the real address. Admin → SEO warns when the address
  it is open on differs from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, which is what happens
  when the bare domain is redirected to www and the setting is not moved.
- **SEO Intelligence.** Every public URL — pages, the home page, each product in
  each market, articles, blog categories, tags and the blog archive — gets SEO,
  AEO and GEO scores from 0 to 100 and an overall score (SEO 50%, AEO 25%,
  GEO 25%). Scores are deterministic checks of what the site actually serves:
  metadata, headings, copy, keywords, links, images, social tags, canonical,
  robots, sitemap, hreflang and structured data. Each check shows its points,
  what it found and how to fix it. A deliberate noindex is reported, never
  scored down, and nothing claims to be a Google or AI platform score.
  - *Content & SEO → SEO Intelligence*: site scores weighted by page type (from
    live, indexable URLs only), score distribution, what needs attention, and a
    searchable, filterable, sortable list with one row per URL per market.
    *Recalculate all* and *Recalculate outdated* run in batches of twenty.
  - A full analysis per URL: every check by section, keyword placement,
    structured data gaps and the JSON-LD emitted, outline, images, links and
    overlap with other pages in the same market.
  - A live score panel in the page, product, product-market and article
    editors, updated as you type without saving, with a button beside each
    issue that goes to the field that fixes it.
- **Three primary keywords** on pages, products, each product market, articles
  and blog categories. Blank is fine, a repeat is refused (case and spacing
  ignored), and a product market with none uses the product's. They are output
  as `<meta name="keywords">`, which search engines do not use for ranking. An
  article's focus keyword became its first primary keyword.
- **A product can name its storage and users rows.** The product form has a
  heading beside each value, with "Storage" and "Users" as placeholders, which
  is also what a blank heading shows. The product page's specification list
  and a comparison table's per-product cards use it; a table row shared by
  several products uses it only when all of them agree.

### Database

Additive migration `20260916150000_country_content_isolation`. No data is reset,
dropped or rewritten:

- `ProductCountry.deletedAt` + an index on `(countryId, deletedAt)`
- `CountrySyncMapping.deletedInTargetAt`
- `ProductCategoryCountry`, `PageCategoryCountry`, `BrandCountry`
- `Form.offerMarketingConsent` default changed to `false`

Backfill grants every existing market exactly what it can see today, so the admin
screens and the public site are unchanged the moment it lands. Products already
deleted globally have their market configurations marked to match, so the change
of meaning does not bring products back into storefronts that had removed them.

Additive migration `20260925140000_seo_intelligence`: nullable
`primaryKeyword1`–`3` on `Page`, `Product`, `ProductCountry`, `BlogPost` and
`BlogCategory`, and a `SeoAudit` table caching one row of scores per URL and
market (removed with its market). Existing focus keywords are copied into
`BlogPost.primaryKeyword1`; `focusKeyword` itself is kept and stays in step.

Migration `20260925120000_product_spec_labels` adds `Product.storageLabel` and
`Product.usersLabel`, both nullable. `20260925130000_product_benefits_heading`
clears the old built-in sub-headings from stored features sections and changes
nothing else in them.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **GA4, GTM and every other marketing tag loaded on the admin too.** The root
  layout rendered the tags and the consent banner, and the root layout wraps
  every route — so they also loaded on `/admin`, the sign-in screen, two-factor
  setup and previews. They now render in the public layout only.
  `isPrivatePath` names the private routes, and a small route guard sets GA's
  `ga-disable-<ID>` flag when a tag loaded on a public page is still in memory
  after a client-side navigation into the admin.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **Public forms could not be submitted at all on a site with no consent notice
  published.** Every submission was rejected with *"That submission could not be
  read. Please try again."* on a correctly filled form. `getCurrentNotice`
  returns version `0` for the wording built into the application, which is the
  state of every deployment until an administrator publishes a notice — and
  nothing seeds one. The page sent that `0` back as the version it had shown,
  the submission schema required `1` or more, and because the consent object
  travels inside the submission envelope, rejecting one field failed the whole
  envelope. Version `0` is now `BUILT_IN_NOTICE_VERSION`, an explicit, valid
  version that every layer accepts and records; published notices still start at
  `1`, so the two can never be confused.

- **Tick boxes could be read as accepted when they were not.** Checkbox values
  went through `z.coerce.boolean()`, which reads the string `"false"` as `true`
  because it is a non-empty string. Ticks are now read only from the tokens a
  checkbox actually posts.

- **Publishing a country-specific consent notice deactivated every other
  market's.** "Current" was scoped by notice key alone, so publishing UAE
  wording silently left India — and every market falling back to the shared
  notice — with no live notice at all. It is now scoped by key *and* market.
  Version allocation retries when two administrators publish at once, instead of
  failing in front of whoever was second.

- **A failed submission could leave the submit button stuck.** An error that was
  not a rejected submission — a dropped connection, a deploy mid-request — left
  the promise rejected and `pending` never cleared, so the button read
  "Sending…" indefinitely with no error shown. Submission is now wrapped, with
  the pending state cleared in `finally`. Filled inputs are preserved either
  way.

- Publishing a notice now revalidates public pages, not just the admin screen.

### Changed

- **One consent tick box per public form**, replacing the separate enquiry,
  marketing and Terms boxes. The wording it covers is written out beneath it,
  and the label is editable per form in Admin → Forms → *a form* → Settings.
  Behind it, enquiry, marketing and Terms are still recorded **separately**:
  each is derived from the box being ticked **and** from that purpose actually
  appearing in what was displayed, so a purpose that was not on screen can never
  be recorded as agreed.

- **Marketing wording may be left empty.** Clearing it in Admin → Leads & CRM →
  Consent notice is a decision, not a gap: no form asks for marketing consent,
  nothing renders, and no blank line or empty container is left behind. The
  built-in wording applies only while no notice has been published, and never
  overrides an intentionally empty saved value. Offering marketing now requires
  both the form's setting **and** non-empty published wording.

- **Marketing can never ride on a required tick box.** A form whose tick box is
  mandatory (lawful basis Consent, or Terms acceptance required) cannot also
  offer marketing in it — that would make marketing a condition of getting a
  reply. Saving that combination is refused with a message naming the switch to
  change, and any form that already holds it has marketing dropped from display
  and recorded as not presented.

- The Leads consent panel and export distinguish marketing **not offered** from
  **offered and declined**, rather than flattening both to "no". New export
  columns: `marketing_state`, `consent_notice_scope`, `consent_label_shown`.

### Added

- **Admin → Settings → Application information**: application name, running
  version, release date and build commit, all read-only and compiled into the
  build.

- `npm run release -- patch|minor|major` — moves `package.json`,
  `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION_README.md` together. It does
  not commit, tag, push or deploy.

- [VERSION_README.md](./VERSION_README.md) and this changelog.

### Database

Additive migration `20260916120000_combined_consent_checkbox`. Four nullable
columns, no backfill, no data rewritten:

- `Form.consentCombinedLabel`
- `ConsentRecord.marketingPresented`, `.displayedLabel`, `.noticeScope`

Existing consent records read "not recorded" for anything that did not exist
when they were written. Nothing is reinterpreted as having accepted the new
combined wording.

## [1.0.0]

Initial release: public site, CMS, CRM, multi-country routing, consent capture,
SEO and content sync.
